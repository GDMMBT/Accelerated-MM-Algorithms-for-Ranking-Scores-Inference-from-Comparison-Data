# Accelerated MM Algorithms for Bradley-Terry Models

This repository contains code and datasets for numerical experiments for MM and Accelerated MM algorithms for generalized Bradley-Terry models, which include classic Bradley-Terry model of paired comparisons, Rao-Kupper model of paired comparison models that allow for tie outcomes, Luce choice model, and Plackett-Luce ranking model. 

The code and datasets in this repository allow one to reproduce numerical experiment result in the following paper:
